# Console Spec (US4) — gitcorpus Operator Console

**Status**: Implemented (2026-10-01→03; outcomes in `../docs/development-log.md`). Approved-for-overnight v1; **UX flow revised 2026-10-02** — see `console-ux-redesign.md`. This spec remains authoritative for the backend and route contract; later phases (corpora, settings, system/metrics, quality, run controls) extended the route table — those rows are marked below, and the implementation is the final authority. Parents: `spec.md` (Frozen v3), `tasks.md` (T019–T037, T051), `contracts/search-api.md`, `data-model.md`. Plan of record: `console-plan.md`.

## Goal

A local single-operator web console for gitcorpus: run live Finds, watch progress, explore/sort/export results, browse run history, diff runs, manage saved filters, optionally clone top-N repos. One FastAPI process, Jinja2 + htmx + one local CSS file — **no Node/toolchain at runtime**.

## Scope

- Completes **US2** (within-run lifecycle: hydrate + ETag, 301 follow, 404 tombstone) and **US3** (enrichment + serve API + filter-spec + runs/replay/export + form + cost planner + clone) per the frozen contract.
- Adds **US4**: run persistence (`runs`, `run_items`, `saved_filters`), console pages, and operator extras (history browser, run-to-run diff, saved filter library, keyboard-first nav, dark mode).
- **Run history is operator-triggered artifacts, not a background index** — the live-only freshness lock stands (no schedulers, no polling of GitHub between runs).
- Non-goals: auth/multi-user, public hosting/ops, SPA-level animation, thesis tracks.

## Backend additions

### Data model (migration `0003_console.py`, down_revision `"0002"` — ruling R38)

```sql
CREATE TABLE runs (
  id            BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  filter_hash   TEXT NOT NULL,              -- sha256 of canonical filter-spec
  filter_spec   JSONB NOT NULL,             -- full validated filter-spec v1 (+frame if any)
  status        TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'queued',  -- queued|running|done|failed|partial|cancelled

  unchanged INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, skipped INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  incomplete_shards INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  error         TEXT,                        -- sanitized message, never an upstream body dump
  bundle_dir    TEXT                         -- runs/{filter_hash}/{run_id}/
);
CREATE INDEX runs_created_idx ON runs (created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX runs_filter_hash_idx ON runs (filter_hash, created_at DESC);

CREATE TABLE run_items (
  run_id        BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES runs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  repo_id       BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES repos(id),
  full_name     CITEXT NOT NULL,
  stargazers    INTEGER, pushed_at TIMESTAMPTZ, archived BOOLEAN,
  language      TEXT, license_spdx TEXT,
  country_iso   CHAR(2), geo_confidence TEXT,
  virtuals      JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}', -- badge flags (has_dockerfile, team_topic, ...)
  PRIMARY KEY (run_id, repo_id)
);
CREATE INDEX run_items_repo_idx ON run_items (repo_id);
CREATE INDEX run_items_stars_idx ON run_items (run_id, stargazers DESC);
-- Amendment (migration 0004, ruling R55): `repo_id` became NULLABLE with
-- ON DELETE SET NULL and a surrogate `id` was added, so a run snapshot
-- survives a repo purge; unique (run_id, repo_id) is retained.
-- Amendment (migrations 0010, 0011, 2026-10-06/07): live progress columns
-- `progress_phase`, `progress_done`, `progress_total`, `progress_updated_at`,
-- `progress_started_at`; cleared on terminal states and orphan recovery.

CREATE TABLE saved_filters (
  id            BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name          TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  filter_spec   JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Run executor

- Single background worker (in-process thread), FIFO queue; one Find at a time; `POST /find` enqueues and redirects.
- Lifecycle: `queued` → `running` → (`done` | `partial` when any shard/page incomplete | `failed` | `cancelled` when the operator stops it). Cancellation is cooperative (`lib/cancellation.py` contextvar, checked in the planner loop, per shard/page, per GraphQL chunk, and per enrichment segment); the in-flight shard is left PENDING so a resume reclaims it. Resume accepts failed, partial, and cancelled runs.
- A throttled reporter (1 s; phase changes immediate) writes the live progress columns. Phases: starting, discovering, hydrating, enriching, writing (labels: Starting, Finding repos, Fetching details, Applying filters, Saving results).
- Uses the existing pipeline (`run_search_discovery` / `run_since_scan` / `run_org_enum`) for discovery, then hydration/enrichment/virtual filters for the result set, then snapshots `run_items` and writes the bundle (`bundle.json` + `corpus.csv`) under `runs/{filter_hash}/{run_id}/`.
- Audit rows continue to be written per response (FR-010).

## UX requirements

- **Dashboard**: recent runs table (id, hash short, status pill, counts, duration, relative time), health badges, quick filter box.
- **Filter form**: every `06 §2` qualifier group with comparator/range widgets; virtual section (`min_stars`, `team_topic`, `has_dockerfile`, `min_commits`, `min_loc`, `owner_country` + confidence threshold); `props.*` gated on single `org:`; live client-side typo hints mirrored from `lib/qualify.py`; "Download as JSON" button producing the exact filter-spec the form would POST.
- **Run detail**: status banner auto-polls via htmx until terminal; live progress line (phase label, done/total, percent bar, phase-relative ETA — needs done ≥ 2, projections over 24 h show "estimating…" — and a client-side ticking elapsed clock that survives htmx swaps); **Stop search** button while queued/running (status becomes Stopped, resumable); results table sortable (stars, pushed, name) and paginated 50/page via htmx fragments; badges for incomplete/truncation (truncation evaluated only for finished runs); per-row provenance tooltip; owner country + confidence; **Found** shows GitHub's `total_count` while the raw fetched count stays under Technical details; export/replay/clone actions and a **Save filter…** modal that stores the run's filter in the library (duplicate names report an error without losing the form).
- **Clone control**: modal with slider + numeric input (top-N by current sort), mode radio (shallow / file-only / windowed), disk estimate with low-disk warning, resumable progress view.
- **Diff**: select a second run for the same filter hash; table of added/removed/changed (stars, pushed_at, archived, status flags) with counts summary.
- **Saved filters**: list with name, hash, last run; one-click load into the form; save-from-form; delete with confirmation.
- **Keyboard-first**: `/` focuses search, `g h` home, `g f` find, `g r` runs, `j/k` row navigation, `Enter` open, `?` shortcut help modal.
- **Dark mode**: `prefers-color-scheme` default + toggle persisted in `localStorage`; no flash-of-wrong-theme (inline script).
- **States everywhere**: loading (htmx indicator), empty (explanatory), error (actionable), disabled (during active runs).

## Error handling

- `400` invalid params render inline with the qualifier hint (never a raw traceback); unknown params never forwarded upstream.
- `502` upstream throttling/outage: banner with retry-after; failed run keeps partial results and a sanitized `error`.
- Incomplete/truncated results are always labeled, never silent; `total_count` displayed as approximate.
- Template-level: every page works with JS disabled for its core read paths (forms still POST).

## Security & ops

- Binds `127.0.0.1:8000` only. No auth (local single-operator) — documented.
- Minimal CSRF protection on POSTs (double-submit token cookie + hidden field).
- Secrets never rendered; `/health` shows only present/absent.
- Start: `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn serve.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000` from a shell with `PYTHONPATH=src`, plus a `src/serve/__main__.py` convenience (`PYTHONPATH=src .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m serve`).
- htmx and the hand-rolled `app.css`/`app.js` are **vendored locally** (`src/serve/static/`), committed; no CDN, no Node/Tailwind build at runtime (R46).

## Testing

- Contract tests for every route (status codes, validation hints, allowlist, export headers/bodies, diff JSON shape, saved-filter CRUD, CSRF reject).
- Template tests (TestClient): key elements/ids present per page, empty/error states render, form produces the exact filter-spec (form ≡ JSON parity test).
- Executor tests: queued→running→done/partial/failed/cancelled with MockTransport + TEST DB; snapshot rows; bundle files written; single-worker FIFO; run-control tests cover Stop/cancel and save-filter.
- Diff unit/integration tests on fixture runs.
- Existing live tests stay; new UI tests are offline. Optional token-guarded live smoke for `POST /find` end-to-end.

## Success criteria

- **SC-005**: From the documented start command, an operator can submit a Find in a browser and see live results with export downloads that parse as valid JSON/CSV.
- **SC-006**: History and diff correctly show added/removed/changed repos on fixture runs.
- **SC-007**: Invalid filters render local hints; zero unknown params reach upstream.
- **SC-008**: No Node/toolchain at runtime; keyboard navigation and dark mode work; every page's read path degrades gracefully without JS.
