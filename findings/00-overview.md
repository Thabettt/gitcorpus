# 00 — Overview: What This Research Is and How to Read It

**Project**: gitcorpus. **Date**: 2026-09-29; live API re-verification 2026-10-06/07 (probe-confirmed facts marked with that date). **Method**: parallel research agents + live docs verification (all sources accessed 2026-09-29 unless noted).

## The one-paragraph version

gitcorpus is a planned continuous, large-scale GitHub repository discovery crawler. Given criteria — language, stars, topics, activity, license, custom tags — it must find *every* matching public repository, not just the first page, and keep that list fresh without burning rate limits or violating GitHub's terms. GitHub's search looks simple (`GET /search/repositories?q=...`) but hides hard constraints that break naive crawlers: only 5 top-level params, all filtering packed into a single `q` string with a closed qualifier set, a 1,000-result ceiling per query, a ~4,000-repo scan scope, silent ignoring of unknown params and typos (still `200 OK`), separate `search` vs `core` rate buckets (30/min vs 5,000/hr), an async search index that lags real pushes, and no server-side custom fields except single-org `props.*`. Around that sit GraphQL, list-enumeration endpoints, GH Archive/BigQuery/World of Code/Software Heritage mirrors, ecosyste.ms/deps.dev enrichment, Sourcegraph code search, and paid scrape wrappers — each with different freshness, cost, and legal trade-offs. This bundle documents all of it so the design is built against reality, not assumptions.

## Goals — the six questions, in order

1. What parameters does repo search actually support? (`01`)
2. How do you use them well at scale — encoding, sorting, paging, throttling, polling? (`02`)
3. Can you add custom parameters, and if not, what are the sanctioned workarounds? (`03`)
4. What already exists that uses these APIs — which tool for which job, at what cost? (`04`)
5. What did we miss that would break a build — the gap audit? (`05`)
6. What is the *complete* universe of repo attributes — searchable, enrichable, mirror-only, or unavailable — and exactly how to get each? (`06`)

**Out of scope**: private-code search internals, Enterprise Server administration, non-GitHub forges. Those are named where excluded so a reviewer doesn't mistake omission for oversight (see `05 §C`).

## Who this is for (and what it assumes)

The reader is a developer about to design or build gitcorpus. You should be comfortable with REST/JSON, URL encoding, pagination, and rate-limit backoff; no prior GitHub Search knowledge is assumed. Keep the glossary below nearby — `q`, the 1000-cap, watermark, and the `S/R/G/L/C/E/M/X` codes recur everywhere.

## Reading paths

- **New to the API?** `00` → `01` (reference) → `02` §§1–6 (power guide) → `03` §§1–3 (verdicts).
- **Designing the crawler?** `02` §§5–7 (playbook + code) → `06` §§4–8 (fetch plan) → `05` §A (critical gaps: `since`-enumeration, `id` PK/lifecycle, auth/SSO, watermark/ETag, bulk datasets, legal gates).
- **Choosing vendors/mirrors?** `04` §§3–7 (datasets + table + a/b/c/d recommendations) → `06` §5 (mirror fields).
- **Implementing filters?** `06` §§2–3 (searchable) + §6 (X→workaround per param) + §7 (typo/validation). Validate every new qualifier with the delta test — silent `200`s lie.

Each file keeps its tables intact; narrative intros sit above them so a newcomer gets the story first and the reference second.

## Glossary (short)

- **`q`** — the single query string carrying keywords + `qualifier:value` filters (e.g. `language:python stars:>500`). Everything GitHub filters on lives inside it.
- **Qualifier** — a documented `name:value` filter inside `q` (a closed set — anything unknown becomes plain text and does nothing).
- **Qualifier union** — repeating the same qualifier type (two `created:` clauses) is a *union*, not an AND; a shard planner must replace the clause, never append (repo-scoped probe, live-verified 2026-10-06/07).
- **1000-cap** — only the first 1,000 results per logical query are fetchable (`10×100`); page 11 at `per_page=100` → `422 "Only the first 1000 search results are available"` (live-verified 2026-10-06/07). `total_count` may be larger, is approximate, and drifts over hours (38,820 → 38,823 → 38,833 in ~5 h; same live probe).
- **4000-scan** — ranking considers at most ~4,000 matching repos per query, so narrow queries rank better.
- **Watermark** — a persisted `max(pushed_at)` per shard (+1h overlap) for incremental polling; never mix a `pushed_at` watermark with `updated_at` ordering without overlap.
- **Pagination drift** — search pagination has no stability guarantee; identical paginated requests can shift or skip items between runs (community-documented, GitHub staff acknowledged — live-verified 2026-10-06/07).
- **`S/R/G/L/C/E/M/X`** — availability codes used in `06`: Search `q` / REST repo / GraphQL / List-enumeration / Custom-props API / Enrichment REST / Mirror dataset / unavailable → workaround.

## Next steps

1. Apply the `05` action-plan patches in order (auth/SSO, `since`-enumeration, `id`-PK lifecycle, watermark/ETag fixes, bulk-dataset bootstrap, legal gates).
2. Prototype the `06 §8` fetch plan against one golden org (e.g. `org:github`) and verify the `id`-set coverage vs a `since` scan before scaling tokens.
3. Re-verify quarterly: pin `X-GitHub-Api-Version`, record response headers, and refresh star/pricing/version numbers (all marked "as of 2026-09-29").
